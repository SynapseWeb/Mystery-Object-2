Steps to build a series:

1. Create or obtain a 3D Object (typically in a tool like Blender).
2. Import into Blender and create slices (use stack of planes and Boolean operator).
3. Save each image to a file in an "images" subdirectory (currently done manually).
4. Create a "series" subdirectory beside the "images" subdirectory to hold Series XML.
5. Use Reconstruct to import images and create the series (note it will move images).
6. Delete the copied images from the "series" directory (we want to get them elsewhere).
7. Edit all section files to insert "../images/" before each image to make it relative.

Steps to create a GitHub project and add files:

1. In GitHub, create a new project (choose name, options, etc).
2. In the project's parent folder, clone the project (copy the url and type: git clone url).
3. Copy the "images" folder and the "series" folder from above into the new project folder.
4. Add the images: git add images/*.jpg
5. Commit the changes: git commit   (add a description via your editor)
6. Add the XML: git add series/*.jpg
7. Commit the changes: git commit   (add a description via your editor)
8. Push the changes to GitHub: git push origin master
